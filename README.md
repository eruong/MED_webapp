# Dining Hall Suggestion Survey
A full-stack Flask web application that processes user input from a survey form to suggest a 5C dining hall for the user to try.

## Introduction & Motivation
Team: Melody Chang, Ethan Ong, Dylan Hou  
Final project for CS35: Computer Science for Insight

What kind of technology is most accessible to the public? The bulk of technology is accessed through the web in the form of full-stack applications. This entails a web interface (front-end) where user interactions are recorded and then processed "behind-the-scenes" (back-end) so that results can be rendered again on the web interface. Currently, students that take at least one computer science course are familiar with the mindset of computation (Java, Python, C) and also with the basic syntax of web design (HTML/Javascript/CSS), however, most students do not know how to create a program such that the front-end interface is dependent on the back-end computations.

Thus, we set out to create a full-stack application from scratch, building an interface that hosts a predictive quiz whose ability to predict is based on the modeling encoded in the Python source code. The below summary gives more detail and specificity into the process of building the app.

## Technology/Framework
Project is created with:  
* HTML
* CSS
* Python v. 3.7
* Main libraries:
  + Flask: micro web framework written in Python
  + pandas/numpy: data manipulation and analysis 
  + skikit-learn: classification algorithms
  + csv: read and write csv files

We created the back-end of our full-stack application, located in the Python source code, to build a model based on the data provided in `quiz.csv` and to predict a user's dining hall classification based on their responses to the survey questions provided. The Python code builds a neural network with two hidden layers, ten neurons each, in order to classify a dining hall an individual would like based on a list of responses to other survey questions. The neural network is built off a CSV file we exported from 70 rows of survey data we collected in a distributed [Google Form](https://forms.gle/sXyx3wJor8ip68Ay7). We also created a functioning front-end for our full-stack application, utilizing HTML/CSS, resembling a survey form, that accepts and temporarily saves the user input. We have also successfully implemented Flask to take the user input collected in the front-end, process the user input in the back-end and render a new webpage displaying our survey modelâ€™s dining hall classification based on the responses the user gave. 

In reflection, the pre-processing in our backend does not perform as well as we hoped as we realize that the data used to build the neural network is very small. Extensive data collection would vastly improve our model accuracy. Additionally, in hindsight, we understand that our questions/features have minimal correlation with the feature our model attempts to predict. Thus, this may likely be the reason for misclassifications.
