# Dining Hall Suggestion Quiz
A full-stack Flask web application that processes user input from a survey form to suggest a 5C dining hall for the user to try.

## Introduction & Motivation
Team: Melody Chang, Ethan Ong, Dylan Hou  
Final project for CS35: Computer Science for Insight

What kind of technology is most accessible to the public? The bulk of technology is accessed through the web in the form of full-stack applications. This entails some sort of web interface (front-end), where the user interactions are recorded and processed "behind-the-scenes" (back-end) so that results can be rendered again on the web interface. Currently, students that take at least one computer science course are familiar with the mindset of computation (Java, Python, C) and also with the basic syntax of web design (HTML/Javascript/CSS), however, most students do not know how to create a program such that the front-end interface is dependent on the back-end computations.

Thus, we set out to create a full-stack application from scratch, building an interface that hosts a predictive quiz whose ability to predict is based on the modeling encoded in the Python source code. The below summary gives more detail and specificity into the process of building the app.

## Technology/Framework
Project is created with:  
* Python v. 3.7
* Main libraries:
  + Flask: micro web framework written in Python
  + HTML/CSS: front-end interface
  + pandas/numpy: data manipulation and analysis
